##Help Others.

Find the stupidest newbies and help them. Regardless of what exactly you help them with, they should rely on you. Show them where the restroom is, recommend a good restaurant nearby, assist in an IDE installation, explain how the project works, and make standard jokes about the worst class in it. They must become your best friendsâ€”and not only them. Be helpful to everybody. No matter what is happening, everyone must know that you're ready to help. Ideally, they all must depend on your kindness and readiness to save them from the chaos around.
